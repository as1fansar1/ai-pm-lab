# Friday — Operations/Customer Support AI Business Workflows
**Date pulled:** 2026-02-20 (UTC)
**Window targeted:** last 30 days
**Theme:** How businesses are using AI to replace/automate support operations

## Executive Summary
Current signal indicates the strongest replacement patterns are in customer support operations: AI handles repetitive frontline tasks while humans handle exceptions and high-empathy cases.

## Top 5 Practical Use Cases (Ops/Support)
1. **Ticket deflection via AI self-service**
   - AI resolves repetitive tickets before human queueing.
2. **Auto triage + routing**
   - AI classifies tickets and routes by intent/severity.
3. **Agent assist during live conversations**
   - AI suggests responses, policy guidance, and next actions.
4. **Knowledge base auto-drafting/updates**
   - AI turns repeated tickets into new help-center content.
5. **QA + sentiment monitoring at scale**
   - AI scores interactions and flags risk/escalations early.

## Best Use Case to Implement First
**Auto triage + routing (support intake copilot)**

### Why first
- Low implementation risk.
- Immediate reduction in manual queue sorting.
- Measurable impact within days (first-response speed, routing accuracy).

## OpenClaw Workflow Mapping (v1)
1. **Trigger:** scheduled support digest + on-demand triage runs
2. **Ingest:** new support messages/tickets from chosen source
3. **Classify:** severity + intent + recommended owner/team
4. **Draft:** suggested first response + escalation reason if needed
5. **Output:** daily action board (high-priority queue first)

## Suggested Pilot KPIs (7-day pilot)
- median first-response time
- % tickets correctly routed on first pass
- deflection rate (AI-resolved vs human-assigned)
- backlog reduction rate

## Source Confidence Notes
- **Medium-low confidence** for social-channel triangulation in this run:
  - Reddit path rate-limited (429)
  - X path auth denied (403)
  - YouTube had few relevant in-range videos and no transcripts
- **Web signal is stronger** this run (recent case-study/operator content)
